Euclidian and Non-Euclidian samples have been generated on Matlab.  

Symmetric and Non-symmetric samples have been produced on C# environment. Nearest neighbor algorithm has been also implemented on C# environment. 

Inputs:

Modal takes inputs in an array form separated by comma.

Exp:

0,12,88,46,12,

12,0,28,10,58,

88,28,0,94,54,

46,10,94,0,36,

12,58,54,36,0


Nearest neighbour takes inputs in a txt file. Each number is separated by one tab space. Location of the file must be given to the 

console program.

Exp:

0	12	88	46	12

12	0	28	10	58

88	28	0	94	54

46	10	94	0	36

12	58	54	36	0
